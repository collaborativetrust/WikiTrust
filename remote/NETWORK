Wikitrust Networking Setup.

The current networking setup is all on Redherring.

==========

/export/notbackedup/wikitrust1/hosted_wikis/firefox/frontend
http://redherring.cse.ucsc.edu/firefox/frontend/index.php

This mediawiki installation is the frontend for the trust coloring.
Requests come in via the Ajax handler, 

(http://redherring.cse.ucsc.edu/firefox/frontend/index.php?action=ajax&rs=TextTrustImpl::getColoredText&rsargs[]=Rio_Grande&rsargs[]=&rsargs[]=34082)

for example.

This in turn tries to retrieve the colored markup from the server.py
server. If it receives colored markup, the markup is converted to
HTML. The final HTML is sent back as an Ajax Response.

==========

/export/notbackedup/wikitrust1/wikitrust_ajax
http://redherring.cse.ucsc.edu:10302

This is the mod_python server. It accepts requests from the frontend server
and fetches content/makes pages to process as needed. 

For testing, this is accessible to the outside network, but for production
it should really be only accessible from localhost. 

===========

Databases:

Again, these are currently all hosted on redherring.

ff_frontend_db -- Empty mediawiki db. This is not used for anything currently.
ff_backend_db -- This is where the magic happens. All of the colored and
non-colored text is currently stored here.
